# OG-DHSRD

Welcome Reader—

[Old Gus' Daggerheart System Reference Document (OG-DHSRD)](https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/) is a hypertext version of the [Daggerheart System Reference Document 1.0](https://www.daggerheart.com/srd/), © Critical Role, LLC, under the terms of the [Darrington Press Community Gaming (DPCGL) License](http://www.darringtonpress.com/license).

This document has been edited. You can use this edition to quickly look up Daggerheart rules online, share them with others, or copy text into a character sheet that works for you. There are no previous modifications by others.

The OG-DHSRD is not a replacement for the [Daggerheart Core Rulebook](https://www.daggerheart.com/buy/), which contains setting information, additional examples of various gameplay elements, and tons of great advice for playing Daggerheart—not to mention gorgeous artwork and the seductive odor of book glue.

Thanks to Darrington Press for this amazing resource, and thank you for reading—and may this record bring you and yours many happy adventures!

—Old Gus
