# Introduction

Welcome Reader—

[Old Gus' Daggerheart System Reference Document (OG-DHSRD)](https://callmepartario.github.io/og-dhsrd/) is a hypertext version of the [Daggerheart System Reference Document 1.0](https://www.daggerheart.com/srd/), © Critical Role, LLC, under the terms of the [Darrington Press Community Gaming (DPCGL) License](http://www.darringtonpress.com/license).

You can use this edition to quickly look up rules online, share them with others, or copy text into a character sheet that works for you.

The OG-DHSRD is not a replacement for the [Daggerheart Core Rulebook](https://www.daggerheart.com/buy/), which contains setting information, additional examples of various gameplay elements, and tons of great advice for playing Daggerheart—not to mention gorgeous artwork and the seductive odor of book glue.

There are no previous modifications by others.

## Editorial Mission

- More readers are players than GMs.
- Some can't see or use the official character sheet, or are developing their own character sheet solutions.
- Some readers prefer metric units.
- Present information so reading orders provide better information groups.
- Correct suspected misprints and increase consistency in formatting of game terms.
- Present information in tables instead of paragraph text.

## Technical Features

- Lightweight, mobile format.
- Accomodate an online header structure and extensive hyperlink document navigation.
- Provide hoverable tooltips on hyperlinks that preview sections of the document. Some tooltips omit sections of text for brevity, indicated by the following statement: See full text for details.
- Add an index of Optional Rules.

## Goals

- Add the the Adversaries and Environments section.
- Add page number references to coresponding sections of the Daggerheart Core Rulebook so readers can easily "get on the same page" even if they are using diffeent sources.
- Continue to improve cross-refrencing and hyperlinking.
- Unlikely, but Possible: Do a plain-language edit across the entire document for clarity, concision, and consistency.
